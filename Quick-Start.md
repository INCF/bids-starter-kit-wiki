Welcome to the BIDS wiki

**Note: this wiki is under construction so the content may change quickly**

The BIDS data specification is a way to structure your raw data and metadata to make it easier to share, reproduce, and organize your data. This wiki is a short guide to get you started. It describes the structure of BIDS-compatible folders, provides a high-level view of the BIDS format, and gives some tips and tricks to get you started.

See the pages in the sidebar for more information.
